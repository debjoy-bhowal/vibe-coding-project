# üå§Ô∏è Sky Runner

An endless flying adventure game with Flappy Bird-like mechanics, enhanced with powerups, weather effects, and beautiful parallax backgrounds!

## üéÆ Game Overview

Sky Runner is an endless runner where you control a bird flying through dynamic skies. Navigate through obstacles, collect powerups, and experience changing weather and time-of-day cycles as you soar to new heights!

## üéØ How to Play

### Objective
- Fly as far as possible while avoiding obstacles
- Collect powerups to gain special abilities
- Beat your high score in this endless adventure

### Controls
- **Tap Screen / Click**: Make the bird flap and fly upward
- **Spacebar**: Alternative control for desktop players
- **Automatic**: Bird falls due to gravity when not flapping

### Game Elements

#### üê¶ The Player Bird
- Controlled by tapping or spacebar
- Realistic physics with gravity and momentum
- Rotates based on flight direction for visual feedback
- Can be affected by powerups (shrinking, enhanced jumps)

#### ‚òÅÔ∏è Obstacles
- **Clouds**: Fluffy white obstacles floating in the sky
- **Birds**: Other flying creatures with gentle bouncing motion
- **Lightning**: Dangerous storm clouds with electrical energy
- **Wind Gusts**: Swirling air currents that block your path

#### ‚ú® Powerups
Three special abilities to help you survive longer:

1. **üïê Time Freeze** (Blue)
   - Slows down all obstacles and game speed
   - Duration: 3 seconds
   - Perfect for navigating tight spaces

2. **üîπ Shrink** (Green)
   - Reduces player size by 50%
   - Makes it easier to dodge obstacles
   - Duration: 5 seconds

3. **‚¨ÜÔ∏è Double Jump** (Yellow)
   - Increases flap power by 50%
   - Jump higher and faster
   - Duration: 8 seconds

## üåÖ Dynamic Environment

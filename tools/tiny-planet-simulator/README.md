# ü™ê Tiny Planet Simulator

An interactive orbital mechanics game where you control gravity to guide planets to their targets!

## üéÆ Game Overview

Tiny Planet Simulator is a physics-based puzzle game that puts you in control of gravitational forces. With a central sun providing constant gravitational pull, your goal is to strategically influence the orbits of planets to hit all targets on the screen.

## üéØ How to Play

### Objective
- Guide all planets to hit the green targets scattered around the screen
- Use gravitational influence to alter planet trajectories
- Complete levels by hitting all targets efficiently

### Controls
- **Click anywhere**: Apply gravitational pull toward your cursor
- **Play/Pause button**: Start or stop the simulation
- **Gravity slider**: Adjust the strength of your gravitational influence (0.5x to 3.0x)
- **Reset button**: Restart the current level
- **New Game button**: Generate a new level with different target positions

### Game Elements

#### üåü The Sun
- Central gravitational body that constantly pulls planets toward it
- Creates natural orbital mechanics
- Acts as a "slingshot" for accelerating planets

#### ü™ê Planets
- Randomly spawn from the edges of the screen
- Different colors and sizes with varying masses
- Automatically orbit the sun due to gravitational physics
- Can be influenced by your cursor clicks

#### üéØ Targets
- Green dashed circles positioned around the screen
- Must be hit by planets to score points
- Pulse animation indicates active targets
- Flash green when successfully hit

#### üí´ Gravity Field
- Optional visualization showing your gravitational influence range
- Toggle on/off in the controls panel
- Helps plan strategic gravitational pulls

## üßÆ Physics System

### Orbital Mechanics
- Realistic gravitational simulation using inverse square law
- Planets naturally establish elliptical orbits around the sun
- Conservation of momentum creates realistic space physics

### Gravitational Influence
- Click-based gravity system allows precise trajectory control
- Gravity strength affects the power of your influence
- Strategic timing creates slingshot effects for maximum acceleration

### Collision Detection
- Accurate planet-to-target collision detection
- Planets are removed upon successful target hits
- Real-time collision feedback with visual effects

## üèÜ Scoring System

### Point Values
- **Base Target Hit**: 100 points
- **Time Bonus**: Additional points based on how quickly you hit targets
- **Completion Bonus**: 500 points for clearing all targets

### Performance Metrics
- **Score**: Total points accumulated
- **Targets Hit**: Number of successful collisions
- **Active Planets**: Current planets in the simulation
- **Gravity**: Current gravitational influence strength
- **Time**: Elapsed game time

## üí° Strategy Guide

### Basic Techniques
1. **Timing is Everything**: Click when planets are positioned for optimal trajectory changes
2. **Use Natural Orbits**: Let planets orbit naturally, then apply gravity at the right moment
3. **Slingshot Maneuvers**: Use the sun's gravity to accelerate planets toward distant targets

### Advanced Strategies
1. **Multi-Target Chains**: Plan routes that hit multiple targets in sequence
2. **Gravity Modulation**: Adjust gravity strength for different situations:
   - Low gravity (0.5-1.0): Precise, gentle course corrections
   - Medium gravity (1.0-2.0): Balanced control and power
   - High gravity (2.0-3.0): Powerful pulls for dramatic trajectory changes

3. **Edge Spawning Prediction**: Anticipate where new planets will spawn and pre-position for intercepts

### Expert Tips
- **Orbital Insertion**: Click behind a planet's trajectory to slow it into a stable orbit
- **Escape Velocity**: Click ahead of a planet to accelerate it beyond orbital capture
- **Gravity Wells**: Create temporary gravity wells to cluster planets before redirecting them
- **Conservation Planning**: Remember that gravity affects all planets - plan for unintended consequences

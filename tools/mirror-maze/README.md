## üéÆ Game Overview

Mirror Maze is an innovative dual-board puzzle game where you control two avatars simultaneously - your real-world character and its mirror reflection. The challenge lies in coordinating both avatars to reach their respective exits while navigating through an increasingly complex maze filled with switches, doors, and deadly traps.

### üéØ Objective

Guide both your **real avatar** (üë§) and **mirror shadow** (üë•) to their respective exits (üö™) simultaneously. Success requires strategic thinking as your movements affect both characters, but with a twist - only left-right movement is mirrored, while up-down movement remains synchronized.

## üïπÔ∏è Game Mechanics

### Movement System
- **Real Avatar**: Moves normally in all directions
- **Mirror Avatar**: 
  - **Up/Down**: Same as real avatar (synchronized)
  - **Left/Right**: Opposite to real avatar (mirrored)
- **Independent Movement**: Each avatar can move individually if their path is clear
- **Obstacle Blocking**: If one avatar is blocked, the other can still move

### Controls
- **Arrow Keys** or **WASD**: Move avatars
- **Mouse/Touch**: Click directional buttons
- **R Key**: Reset current level
- **H Key**: Toggle level hint
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Full support for rapid gameplay

### Game Elements

| Element | Icon | Function |
|---------|------|----------|
| **Exit** | üö™ | Goal destination - both avatars must reach their exits |
| **Switch** | ‚ö° | Toggles all doors between open/closed states |
| **Door (Closed)** | üö´ | Blocks movement - can be opened by hitting switches |
| **Door (Open)** | ‚¨ú | Allows passage through - can be closed by switches |
| **Trap** | üíÄ | Instant death - touching resets the level |
| **Wall** | ‚ñì | Permanent barrier that blocks movement |
| **Floor** | ‚ñë | Safe walkable area |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Advanced Mechanics

### Door Trapping System
- **Dangerous Positioning**: Standing on a door when it closes will **trap** that avatar
- **Movement Restriction**: Trapped avatars cannot move until the door reopens
- **Escape Mechanism**: Hit another switch to reopen doors and free trapped avatars
- **Strategic Risk**: Use door timing as part of puzzle-solving strategy

### Victory Conditions
- **Simultaneous Victory**: Both avatars must reach their exits at the same time
- **No Partial Success**: Reaching only one exit doesn't complete the level
- **Perfect Timing**: Plan your moves to coordinate both avatars' arrival
